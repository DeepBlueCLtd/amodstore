Notes on pygeoapi for setup compiled before billing commenced.

It's simple to pull the docker image. 

You then need to provide reference to an external config file and any
data stores

In the case of this project you need to be able to boot the docker 
referencing either the PostGIS or SQLite back end.

docker run -p 5000:80 \
-v $(pwd)/default.config.yml:/pygeoapi/local.config.yml \
geopython/pygeoapi:latest

This is using a custom config file. -v denotes the volumes.

Cleaner than this is to use a docker compose YAML.

$(pwd) indicates the working folder from which you start the container.

YAML config file, e.g. default.config.yml
